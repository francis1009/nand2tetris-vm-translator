# ===================================================================
# .clang-format Configuration for a C Project
# Based on LLVM style with specific customizations.
# ===================================================================

# Language: C
BasedOnStyle: LLVM

# --- Core User Requirements ---

# Use hard tabs for indentation, not spaces.
UseTab: Always
# Each indentation level is 2 spaces wide.
IndentWidth: 2
# When aligning code, a tab character is treated as 2 spaces wide.
TabWidth: 2
# Maximum line length before wrapping.
ColumnLimit: 80

# --- Recommended Settings for Readability & Structure ---

# Pointer alignment: place the '*' next to the variable (e.g., int *ptr).
# Other options: Left (int* ptr), Middle (int * ptr).
PointerAlignment: Right

# Control brace wrapping. This keeps the LLVM style of attached braces.
# e.g., if (condition) {
BreakBeforeBraces: Attach
BraceWrapping:
  AfterFunction: true
  AfterStruct: true
  AfterEnum: true

# Do not put short functions on a single line.
# e.g., void func() { return; } will be broken into multiple lines.
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None
AllowShortCaseLabelsOnASingleLine: false
AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: false
AllowShortLoopsOnASingleLine: false
ReflowComments: true

# --- Include Management ---
# Automatically sort #include directives to keep them clean.
SortIncludes: true
# Group includes into categories.
IncludeBlocks: Regroup
IncludeCategories:
  # Matches C standard library headers (e.g., <stdio.h>).
  # Catches headers in angle brackets that DO NOT contain a '/'.
  - Regex:           '^<[^/]+\.h>'
    Priority:        10

  # Matches all other headers in angle brackets (e.g., <sys/socket.h>).
  # This is the general-purpose rule for third-party libraries.
  - Regex:           '^<.*\.h>'
    Priority:        20

  # Matches all local project headers (e.g., "cpu.h").
  # This catches anything in double-quotes.
  - Regex:           '^".*\.h"'
    Priority:        30

# --- Whitespace Control ---

# The number of empty lines to keep is at most 1.
# Prevents large vertical gaps in the code.
MaxEmptyLinesToKeep: 1

# Add a space after the C-style cast, e.g., (int) x instead of (int)x.
SpaceAfterCStyleCast: true
SpaceBeforeParens: ControlStatements

# Ensure that a file ends with a newline character.
InsertNewlineAtEOF: true
